    "## Introduction\n",
    "As a data scientist, you want to share your work with others and reach a larger audience. Medium is a popular platform for this purpose, but it has limitations when it comes to data representation. To overcome this, I discovered Hashnode, a platform specifically designed for developers and the tech industry. It offers a powerful editor that supports markdown text, including tables, and provides an Amazon AWS S3 bucket for uploading images.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the process of converting Jupyter Notebooks into Hashnode stories, I created a tool called Jupyter2Hashnode. With Jupyter2Hashnode, you can convert Jupyter Notebooks into Hashnode stories with just a single command. The tool compresses images, uploads them to the Hashnode server, updates image URLs in the markdown file, and finally, publishes the story article.\n",
